"""Where a `Modifier` chain starts -- and the only thing about `Modifier` that is hand-written.

## What used to be here

A copy of the Button wrapper. `padding()` composed nothing, `fill_max_size()` returned `self`, and
lines 20-22 searched `ButtonKt.__dict__` for a name beginning `"Button-"` -- a prefix search over
Kotlin's value-class mangling suffix. That search is not merely broken, it is *impossible*: the
suffix hashes the value-class signature only, so `padding`, `size`, `width` and `height` all mangle
to `-3ABfNKs` and a name lookup cannot tell them apart. Looking a Kotlin declaration up by JVM name
is a removed option (`agent-rules.md` §12); the binder generates Kotlin source and lets `kotlinc`
mangle it.

## What replaced it, and where that lives

Not here. `Modifier` is an ordinary proxy the adaptation layer builds from the upcall table:
`pythonx._proxy_type('androidx.compose.ui.Modifier')`, reached as `pythonx.compose.ui.Modifier`.
Every one of its methods is a `Modifier` extension the artefact walker bound out of Compose's own
jars -- 104 of them at last count (`docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §3.2) -- and each is
attached to the proxy type on first read and never resolved again. So:

    Modifier.padding(16).size(24)          # chained, with zero hand-written wrappers
    padding(m, horizontal=8, vertical=4)   # dispatched among four `padding` overloads

None of that is per-declaration Python, which is exactly why none of it is a file
(`docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §7). **If this file ever grows a `def padding`, the 2024 mistake
has been made again.**

## What is left, and why it cannot be derived

One fact, and it is data rather than code: **the name of a Kotlin function that returns an empty
`Modifier`.**

`Modifier` as a Kotlin *expression* is `Modifier.Companion`, an object instance, and the artefact
walker binds functions. So the empty modifier every chain starts from has **no bound name**, and the
adaptation layer refuses to invent one -- `Modifier.padding(16)` raises a `TypeError` naming
`register_empty` rather than guessing. Registering that name is the seam, and this file is it.

**No such function exists in Compose today.** `androidx.compose.ui.emptyModifier` is the name
`ComposeShapedFragment` uses for the fixture, and it is a placeholder: against the real jars nothing
is bound under it, so the class-object spelling does not yet work and only the instance spelling
(`m.padding(16)`, on a `Modifier` Kotlin handed out) does. Closing that needs one line of Kotlin in
the consuming application -- `fun emptyModifier(): Modifier = Modifier`, picked up by KSP -- and
[install] is where its name is supplied.

## How this module is reached

By path, for now. Under the host adaptation layer `sys.modules['pythonx']` is built by
`PythonxAdapter.DELIVERY` with `__path__ = []`, so no `pythonx/...` file on disk is importable at
all; `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §2.5 ("where `pythonx`'s own `.py` files live") is open and
this file is inside it. Until it closes, an application loads this module with
`importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` and calls [install]. Nothing here depends on being imported
as `pythonx.compose.ui.modifier`.
