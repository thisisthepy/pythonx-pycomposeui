"""`pythonx/compose/material3/` -- which per-declaration wrappers the adaptation layer already covers.

`Text` is the one this asserts, and only this one: `docs/...` (`ComposableRenderTest.kt`,
`PythonMultiplatform` commit `c60bcfeb`) proved `from pythonx.compose.material3 import Text;
Text('hi')` draws real pixels through the walked `material3` jar with **no Python wrapper at all** --
the same shape `test_modifier_module.py` proved for `Modifier.padding`. `pythonx/compose/material3/
text.py` predates that: it imports `androidx.compose.material3.TextKt` directly (a mechanism this
tree no longer has) and, on the way in, does the exact `name.startswith("Text-")` mangled-suffix
search `test_modifier_module.TheShellIsGone` already bans for `Modifier` -- the same impossible
search, since Kotlin's value-class mangling suffix hashes the signature and not the name. It cannot
be repaired; it can only be removed, the way `modifier.py`'s copy of it was.

Nothing here proves Compose still renders `Text` -- that is `ComposableRenderTest.kt`'s job, in the
other repository, and it needs a JVM this repository does not have. What this checks is local: that
the dead wrapper is gone and nothing in this repository still points at it.

`Icon`, `ColorScheme`, `lightColorScheme` and `darkColorScheme` are the same shape (`TextKt` /
`IconKt` / `ColorSchemeKt` imports, the same mangled-suffix search) but nothing has independently
confirmed them walked and rendering the way `Text` is confirmed -- so they are left alone here rather
than asserted dead on architecture alone. `docs/` and the migration report list them as the same
class of finding, unconfirmed.

`Button`, `Card`, `ListItem`, `Badge`/`BadgedBox`, `MaterialTheme` and (half of) `IconButton` are the
same shape again, on `PythonMultiplatform` commit `a6742a1c` (`ComposableRenderTest.kt`): each renders
from Python with no wrapper, content lambda and `on_click` included where the declaration has one.

`icon_button.py` is now gone entirely. `PythonMultiplatform` commit `3fde8bd6`
(`CallbackDrivenRenderTest.kt`) is the render proof the previous version of this module's docstring
said was missing: it drives `Checkbox`'s `onCheckedChange` with a real pointer press and release
through `ImageComposeScene.sendPointerEvent` -- no window, no display -- and asserts the Python
callback ran with the value Compose handed it (`_cb_events == [True]`) and that a fresh render shows
the state it wrote. `theSameCallbackShapeIsDrivenOnASecondDeclaration` repeats it on `Switch`,
deliberately: a different file (`SwitchKt` vs `CheckboxKt`), a different declaration, the identical
`(Boolean) -> Unit` shape, written specifically to rule out "a lucky slot index that only happens to
work for `Checkbox`". `IconToggleButton`/`FilledIconToggleButton`/`FilledTonalIconToggleButton`/
`OutlinedIconToggleButton` are a *third* declaration (`IconButtonKt`, a third file again) with that
same shape and the same parameter names (`checked: Boolean`, `onCheckedChange: (Boolean) -> Unit`) --
the evidence the render test was built to generalise across declaration boundaries applies to them
for the same reason it already covers two unrelated files. So the four toggle classes are deleted the
same way `IconButton`'s plain siblings were.

`text_field.py`'s `TextField`/`OutlinedTextField` were the one case the callback-shape
generalisation above could not reach: `on_value_change` is `(String) -> Unit`, not
`(Boolean) -> Unit`, and `CallbackDrivenRenderTest.kt` used to drive only the Boolean shape. That gap
is closed now. `PythonMultiplatform` commit `cac8243f`
(`typingIntoATextFieldInvokesThePythonCallbackWithTheStringAndTheNextRenderShowsIt` and
`twoKeystrokesAccumulateAcrossTwoFreshScenes`, both in `CallbackDrivenRenderTest.kt`) delivers real
key events through `ImageComposeScene.sendKeyEvent` to a `pythonx`-bound `TextField`, asserts the
Python callback received the typed string, and asserts a fresh render shows it -- then repeats that
across two scenes to show the string *accumulates* (`'h'` then `'hi'`), not just that one keystroke
lands. That is the same evidentiary bar the `(Boolean) -> Unit` shape met for `Checkbox`/`Switch`,
now met for `(String) -> Unit`, so `text_field.py` is gone the same way `icon_button.py` was.

Nothing here proves Compose still renders `IconToggleButton` or `TextField` when it composes for
real -- that render-with-real-Compose claim is what `CallbackDrivenRenderTest.kt` supplies, in the
other repository. What this file checks is local: that the dead wrapper is gone and nothing in this
repository still points at it, the same thing it already checked for `Text` and for `Button`'s
siblings.

    the walked table, not merely unconfirmed: `Icon` needs an `ImageBitmap`/`ImageVector`/`Painter`
    nothing walked can produce, and the two color-scheme factories need 36 `Color` parameters against
    the binding's 6-parameter omission cap. "Pinned unreachable" is a different conclusion from the
    evidence that deleted `text.py`, `icon_button.py` and now `text_field.py`: those were proven
    *redundant* (the walked table draws the same declaration with no wrapper), so the wrapper could
    go. `Icon`/`ColorScheme` were proven *uncallable any way at all*, which makes the hand-written
    wrapper the only Python-facing record of that fact -- so `text_field.py`'s reasoning does not
    apply and these two files stay, per this task's own instruction.

    Both files still wrote the 2024 shape, `class Icon(Composable):` /
    `class ColorScheme(Composable):`, inheriting from `pythonx.compose.runtime.Composable`. Commit
    `7d6c0a1` replaced that name's *class* with a plain identity-decorator *function* -- correct for
    `UI.ipynb`'s `@Composable def Screen(): ...` usage, but a function cannot be a base class, so the
    `class` statement itself now raises `TypeError` the moment either file is loaded. Because
    `pythonx/compose/material3/__init__.py` imports both unconditionally (`from .icon import *`,

    pythonx.compose.material3` as a whole -- every other, working declaration (`Button`, `Card`,
    `Text`, ...) included, not just the two that are genuinely unreachable. That is the regression
    this class checks is fixed: loading each file must not raise, which it can satisfy without
    claiming `Icon`/`ColorScheme` now render (they still cannot -- see the class docstrings in each
    file) by simply not inheriting from something that is no longer a class.
