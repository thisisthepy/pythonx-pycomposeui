"""`pythonx/compose/runtime/__init__.py` -- the 2024 `Composable` class, gone, and what is left.

## What used to be here, and why it never ran

A decorator class (`Composable`) holding one `__composer`, plus `ComposeApp`, `KotlinComposable`,
`KotlinWidget` and a `CoroutineScope` family, all built on `jclass` --
`_runtime = jclass("io.github.thisisthepy.pycomposeui.RuntimeKt")` -- chaquopy's name-based
Java/Kotlin class lookup. `jclass` is never imported in this module, in any commit where the module
had content, so every one of those five module-level statements raised `NameError` before a single
class body executed:

    >>> from pythonx.compose.runtime import Composable
    NameError: name 'jclass' is not defined

That is not incidental breakage, it is a different technology than this repository now targets.
`jclass` is chaquopy's global; `PythonMultiplatform`'s binder is a different bridge
(`docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5.1 reads the same class as "the 2024 `Composable` class", and
`agent-rules.md` §12 retires name-based JVM lookup by name). `Composable.__call__`'s other job --
inspecting `self.compose.__code__.co_varnames` to find where `content` sits -- is retired for the
same reason `modifier.py`'s mangled-suffix search was: `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5.6/§7
record that composer threading, `$changed` and `$default` are now arithmetic
`pythonx._bind_composable` does from a slot's *declared type*, uniformly, for a content lambda
exactly as for any other parameter -- there is nothing left for a Python-side base class to detect.

## What is left

One identity decorator, `Composable`, kept because `UI.ipynb` writes `@Composable` on every
screen-defining function and that surface is one an application author should keep being able to
write. Nothing needs to happen to the decorated function for it to work: the composer any nested
`pythonx.compose.*` call needs comes from `PythonComposition`'s push/pop around the whole exec pass
and from the *callee's* slot type, never from the caller.

## What this file cannot do

`pythonx.compose.runtime` is not reachable through `import pythonx.compose.runtime` once
`PythonxAdapter.install()` has run -- the same reason `pythonx/compose/ui/modifier.py`'s docstring
gives for `pythonx.compose.ui.modifier`, and confirmed directly below
(`TheModuleIsUnreachableByOrdinaryImport`) against the real adapter source, not assumed from reading
Kotlin. `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §2.5 in `PythonMultiplatform` is where a real fix is open;
this repository loads the file by path instead, the same way `modifier.py` already is.
